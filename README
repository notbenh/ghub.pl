NOTE: Yes I know that there are many other 'github' scripts that will do most of what I want, sadly all the ones that I've played with get me close but don't do exactly what I want... thus I'm making my own. This is going to be a very me focused project so you might or might not be able to use this to do anything else. 

Just wanted to get that out there.

GOAL: 

Lets say that I've got a GH fork of some project. I want to be able to type something like: 

<code>
> ghub.pl clone notbenh/some_project
</code>

What I want this to do is:
1) check to see if there is a repo notbenh/some_project if so clone
2) if said repo is a fork, add a remote 'upstream' and '$username' for the forked-from repo

EXTRA BONUS: 

Because I'm going to be playing with the GitHub API already to do the fork check it should be simple to also allow said script to clone more then a single project, like:

<code>
> ghub.pl clone notbenh # clone all my repos including watched
</code>

and if I get around to it I might get around to building a 'update' command that would update all my local repos ... though this is more a TODO list at this point.
